Projet PinkBombs_Data4Good

## General Project:
Supported by Data4Good and Systemik.  
Create a web plateform to aggregate all kinds of data about Salmons production, consumption and relevant environmental impacts.

## Play my part:
- Understanding, cleaning and first draft of presentation for Data from OECD.
- Gathering data related to the environmental impact of chemicals (antibiotics...) and feces rejection.

Asociated files:

Paper on Salmo Salar Biology, and farming.

## OECD data - *Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development*:
**Link** = https://www.oecd.org/  
**Timeframe** = 2010-2021  
**Dataframes** = 
* Inland fisheries _ Tonnes
* Marine Landings (*DÃ©barquement*) in domestic ports or foreign ports _ Tonnes, US Dollars and National Currency
* Aquacutlure production _ Tonnes and US Dollars

### Data cleaning:
Dataframes rearranged in more easily analysable Dataframes.
Loaded on Data4Good drive

Still need to do a Dashboard to answer questions:
* Amount and % of production of Atlantic Salmon *Salmo Sala* compared to fishes production per country, per year.
* Amount and % of production of Atlantic Salmon *Salmo Sala* compared to 'Salmons, Trouts, Smelts' production per country, per year.
* Biggest producers of *Salmo Salar*
* Biggest landings of *Salmo Salar*
* Evolution of *Salmo Salar* production in Tonnes, US Dollars per country.
* Evolution of *Salmo Salar* production in % of all fishes per country.
* Evolution of *Salmo Salar* production in % of 'Salmons, Trouts, Smelts' per country.

### Files:
*.csv files for data (3)* 
* Aquatic_prod_TON_USD_2010-2021_All_OECD.csv
* FISH_LANDINGS_2000_2021-Total_OECD.csv
* inland_fisheries_TON_2010-2021_All_OECD.csv
  
*ReadMe file for translation of concepts*
* OECD _ ReadMe.odt
